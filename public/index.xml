      <description>&lt;p&gt;The very first time I started blogging I used a Java based blogging platform called &lt;a href=&#34;https://pebble.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Pebble&lt;/a&gt;. If you look at it, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how long ago that was. Blogging had just become something people did and I had some level of success mostly due to the newness of it all. I was writing &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; articles and they seemed to resonate. At that time I was also heavily involved with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coderanch.com&#34;&gt;CodeRanch&lt;/a&gt;, formally known as JavaRanch. So I would often take my answers there, and expound on them on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing Spring Data JDBC Repositories with Test Containers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, for a side project, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the motion of Spring Data JPA to JDBC and then found a middle-ground with Spring Data JDBC. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to loathe ORM&amp;rsquo;s but I don&amp;rsquo;t need to hand wire SQL statements into Row Mappers for basic CRUD operations. Spring Data JDBC seems to be as close to an ORM (it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a Row Mapper) as I want to get. Plus, I can always revert down to JDBC with &lt;code&gt;JdbcTempate&lt;/code&gt; if I want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
