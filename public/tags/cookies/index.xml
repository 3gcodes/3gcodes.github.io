      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Board Game Collection side project. The backend is Spring Boot with a Neo4J database. Mostly, I use this project as a learning tool as well as for personal use. I built a small mobile app as the client in Flutter but over time realized native mobile was unnecessary. So as another learning opportunity I&amp;rsquo;ve been bouncing back and forth between using JTE with HTMX as well as learning Svelte.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
