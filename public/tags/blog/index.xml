      <description>&lt;p&gt;The very first time I started blogging I used a Java based blogging platform called &lt;a href=&#34;https://pebble.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Pebble&lt;/a&gt;. If you look at it, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how long ago that was. Blogging had just become something people did and I had some level of success mostly due to the newness of it all. I was writing &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; articles and they seemed to resonate. At that time I was also heavily involved with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coderanch.com&#34;&gt;CodeRanch&lt;/a&gt;, formally known as JavaRanch. So I would often take my answers there, and expound on them on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
